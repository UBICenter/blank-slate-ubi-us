# Blank Slate UBI in the United States: analysis log

This is the log kept of the analysis process in writing the Blank Slate paper.

### 0.0.1

Initial run of the solver for the Foundational UBI model (child, adult and senior amounts) generates
the following results:

```console
Foundational UBI:
  Child: $3,241 per year
  Adult: $9,047 per year
  Senior: $9,343 per year
Mean percentage loss: 4.59%
```

This seems roughly similar to the results from the [UK model](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/socialliberalforum/pages/3398/attachments/original/1620835589/SLF_UBI_Center_Report_FINAL.pdf?1620835589), which achieved 4.9% in the Foundational model and 4.4% in more specific models. But these are very early results and the UK abolished more benefits than we have here.
